# EuropeanCountryChatbot
My Artificial Intelligence coursework where I received a grade of: 1HIGH

A European Countries chat-bot that utilises rule and similarity based conversation.
This chatbot also utilised image classification.

The full list of tasks this project aimed to complete are listed below:

_### Rule/Similarity-based conversations on European Countries_
Implemented rule-based conversation through use of AIML.  
Implemented similarity-based conversation using bag-of-words model, TF-IDF, and cosine similarity.  
Extra functionality: Use of API to answer questions about currency, flags, etc.

_### First-order and Fuzzy logic on European Countries_
Implemented first order logic with knowledgebase and inference engine using NLTK library.  
Extra functionality: Implemented fuzzy logic inference system.

_### Local and multi-object image classification of European Wonders_
Implemented local image classification through use of a convolutional neural network model.  
Extra functionality: Implemented multi-object detection in images and implemented manual hyper-parameter tuning.

_### Cloud-based image classification of European Wonders and facial recongition of European leaders_
Implemented cloud-based image classification through a model developed on Azure cloud with custom vision. Azure image analysis also implemented.  
Extra functionality: Implemented facial recognition using an Azure AI service in the computer vision group.
